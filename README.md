# Containerized App Exercise

## **Overview**

This application will utilize machine learning to assist with exercise, namely counting jumping jacks as well as tracking calories burned per session and over the usage lifetime. 

This project provides a containerized system through these subsystems:
1. **ML Backend:** Uses camera data to perform ML-based jumping jack tracking
2. **Database:** MongoDB database for storing data
3. **Web Interface:** Front-end display using Flask that displays data and enables user interfacing.
